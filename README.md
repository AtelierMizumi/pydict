# PyDict, a simple dictionary program written in Python using Wordnik API to get the word's definition

This is a dictionary that runs on terminal (maybe a GUI later).

These are all written by ChatGPT because I don't know shits and I do this just for fun.

So anything, do not expect this to work well. If you ever try to blame the code, you already read what I've just said.
